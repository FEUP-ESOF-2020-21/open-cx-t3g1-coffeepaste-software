## Product Vision

In this new era where online meetings are a big part of our contact with the outside world, this application comes to solve the organizing gap that exists for virtual arrangement. Clip Meet provides the best environment for speed networking through computation and matching algorithms in order to make the experience smooth and effective.


**Clipped meetings, live changing encounters.**

## Elevator Pitch

The team is developing a mobile application that people can use to participate in Speed networkings remotely that makes use of a  matching algorithm. This means that after answering a few questions, our user will be matched with other people with similar interests for their meet through a video conference.

We care about our user experience in speed meetings. In order to make the experience more agreeable, and in some way funnier, we provide the option of generating matches, which ensures more enjoyable and oportunistic encounters. 

After effectuating the login, and signing up to the meeting of desire, a selection of questions are arranged that best describe the meeting at hand. After the experience of the speed networking session, the user can evaluate the matches and request the information of people that he has the interest developing future connections. 

In these times when almost one-third of the world population is staying at home, how are you increasing our network?

## Requirements

### Use case diagram

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/user_cases.png" alt="User Cases"/> </p>

Create a use-case diagram in UML with all high-level use cases possibly addressed by your module.

Give each use case a concise, results-oriented name. Use cases should reflect the tasks the user needs to be able to accomplish using the system. Include an action verb and a noun. 

Briefly describe each use case mentioning the following:

* **Actor**. Name only the actor that will be initiating this use case, i.e. a person or other entity external to the software system being specified who interacts with the system and performs use cases to accomplish tasks. 
* **Description**. Provide a brief description of the reason for and outcome of this use case, or a high-level description of the sequence of actions and the outcome of executing the use case. 
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Include any activities that must take place, or any conditions that must be true, before the use case can be started (preconditions). Describe also the state of the system at the conclusion of the use case execution (postconditions). 

* **Normal Flow**. Provide a detailed description of the user actions and system responses that will take place during execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. This dialog sequence will ultimately lead to accomplishing the goal stated in the use case name and description. This is best done as a numbered list of actions performed by the actor, alternating with responses provided by the system. 
* **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**. Document other, legitimate usage scenarios that can take place within this use case, stating any differences in the sequence of steps that take place. In addition, describe any anticipated error conditions that could occur during execution of the use case, and define how the system is to respond to those conditions. 

### User stories

**Link:** https://trello.com/b/pBEOztO7/coffepaste-project

This section will contain the requirements of the product described as **user stories**, organized in a global **[user story map](https://plan.io/blog/user-story-mapping/)** with **user roles** or **themes**.

For each theme, or role, you may add a small description. User stories should be detailed in the tool you decided to use for project management (e.g. trello or github projects).

A user story is a description of desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is 

*As a < user role >, I want < goal > so that < reason >.*


**INVEST in good user stories**. 
You may add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the [INVEST guidelines](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).

**User interface mockups**.
After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable.

**Acceptance tests**.
For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in Gherkin), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story.

**Value and effort**.
At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it, for example, using t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).
