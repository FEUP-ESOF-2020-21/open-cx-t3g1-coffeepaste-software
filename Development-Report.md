## Product Vision

In this new era where online meetings are a big part of our contact with the outside world, this application comes to solve the organizing gap that exists for virtual arrangement. Clip Meet provides the best environment for speed networking through computation and matching algorithms in order to make the experience smooth and effective.


**Clipped meetings, live changing encounters.**

## Elevator Pitch

The team is developing a mobile application that people can use to participate in Speed networkings remotely that makes use of a  matching algorithm. This means that after answering a few questions, our user will be matched with other people with similar interests for their meet through a video conference.

We care about our user experience in speed meetings. In order to make the experience more agreeable, and in some way funnier, we provide the option of generating matches, which ensures more enjoyable and oportunistic encounters. 

After effectuating the login, and signing up to the meeting of desire, a selection of questions are arranged that best describe the meeting at hand. After the experience of the speed networking session, the user can evaluate the matches and request the information of people that he has the interest developing future connections. 

In these times when almost one-third of the world population is staying at home, how are you increasing our network?
